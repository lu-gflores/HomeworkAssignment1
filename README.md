# Horiseon 

## Description
This project originially contained only non-semantic elements which made web accessiblity difficult. These elements also made the code difficult for developers to read since they do not specify their purpose. Finally, because the code contained non-semantic tags, this makes search engines difficult to understand what the page is about and may not appear as frequently in the search results. As a beginner, this project serves as good practice on how to change the code so that it is accessible. 
The purpose of this project was to refactor the exisiting code so that it meets the standard requirements for web accessibility and restructure the elements as necessary. To make sure that I achieve these goals, I kept the follow user story and acceptance criteria in mind.


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
